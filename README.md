# Birthday Greeter

## Action Plan

In order to test my understanding of web apps and verify that I can build a simple web app with a form using an MVC framework, I will build a birthday greeter app.



When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:
 - wish the user happy birthday
 - tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday
